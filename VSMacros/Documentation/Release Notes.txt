Version: 1.1

What's New:
	- Improved recording output
	- Improved playback functionality
	- Drag and drop macros
	- Search macros
	- Add new macros and new folders directly from the Macro Browser List
	- DTE Intellisense when editing macros
	- UI Improvements
	- Various bug fixes and improvements

Installation Instructions:
	- Install extension
	- Run VS
	- Open Macro Folder (Ctrl+M, O)
	- Extract Macros.zip to that folder, overwritting if asked

Suggested Testing:
	- Playback "New File" -> creates a new javascript file
	- Save file anywhere
	- Playback "C#/Header" -> add a header containing the file name
	- Playback "New File" again
	- Copy the contents of "Parse macro text.txt" (was in the same folder as the VSIX) to the new file
	- Place the cursor at the beginning of the file (line 0, col 0)
	- Playback "EnvDTE.TextSelection.cs" -> converts c# properties to a javascript object that can be used by Intellisense

Warning:
	- Closing the terminal window crashes the extension
	- Drag and drop has been altered when we integrated Execution into the package
